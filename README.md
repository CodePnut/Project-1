## Technologies used
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- GitHub Pages
- Midjourney & Dall-E

## Favourite Function
- Creating a bot function that automate movesets
- CSS animation & media

## Challenges and Takeaways
- Implementing the image icons and associate it with multiple functions
  => This was very challenging for me as my function foundation is still relatively weak.

- CSS Styling
  => I did many trial and errors to get how I wanted it to look like. Then I found that I could pinpoint the issue using the DOM.

- Debugging
  => I'm relatively weak on debugging my code. There are several times where I created empty functions. This caused conflicts on my entire code      file.

- Uploading my files to Github.
  => First commit, the images were not showing up while it's entire fine when viewed locally. So much frustrations on this part but I've             finally got it to work.

Overal, I'm quite happy with my performance. Moving onwards, I need to utilise the DOM system more to make my coding experience more precise and efficient.

## Next steps
- Implement Smart Bot player Algorythm (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- More Theme customisations (Font, Icon images, Outlines)
- Create an option for players to switch sides
- Implement unique game conditionals
- Create an option/condition as to when player 2 starts first.
